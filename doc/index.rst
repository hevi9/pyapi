How pyapi is related to sphinx ?
--------------------------------

pyapi is not meant to be a replacement to the sphinx, but a quick complement
to the developer's documentation tasks. Starting up and writing sphinx software
documentation takes some time. pyapi constructs API documentation quickly just
by running command line tool without any extra files. Presentation is another 
thing, sphinx documentation produces book-a-like style programming manual, pyapi
makes compact "summary" about python modules programming API.
